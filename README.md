# MATLAB-RL-Agent_with_SimEvents
## Overview
This is an example of using the Q-Agent from the MATLAB Reinforcement Learning Toolbox with a discrete-event-based SimEvents model. It shows a procedure that makes it possible to use the agent in an event-driven manner. It can also be transferred to other agents in the toolbox.

The Simulink model is structured using the concept of Experimental Frame (see also [EFforRL_MATLAB_CaseStudy](https://github.com/cea-wismar/EFforRL_MATLAB_CaseStudy) repository and the corresponding [paper on ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372059172_Integration_of_Reinforcement_Learning_and_Discrete_Event_Simulation_Using_the_Concept_of_Experimental_Frame) ).
