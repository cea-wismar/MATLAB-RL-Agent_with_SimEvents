# MATLAB-RL-Agent_with_SimEvents

![Simulink Preview](images/SimulinkPreview.png)
## Overview
This is an example of using the Q-Agent from the MATLAB Reinforcement Learning Toolbox with a discrete-event-based SimEvents model. It shows a procedure that makes it possible to use the agent in an event-driven manner. It can also be transferred to other agents in the toolbox.

The Simulink model is structured using the concept of Experimental Frame. Please refer to the following publications:
